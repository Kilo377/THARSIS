### 🔥 Motivations

Limited Perceptual Dimensions
Most existing systems rely on shallow behavior modeling, lacking comprehensive understanding of user emotion, behavioral continuity, underlying motivations, and the influence of environmental context.

Fragmented and Sensitive Data
Multi-source sensory data is often fragmented and lacks unified structure. Moreover, the raw data is privacy-sensitive, posing significant challenges for secure integration and analysis.

Weak Intent Inference
Current systems mainly respond to explicit commands, failing to recognize or predict users' implicit intents. This reflects a dual challenge: the absence of high-quality annotated datasets and the lack of effective predictive models.
