## **Overview**

THARSIS builds an AI-native, human-centric perception system.  
It bridges **physical sensing** and **digital cognition**, generating a privacy-preserving digital twin capable of **continuous state understanding**, **intent prediction**, and **context-aware behavior modeling**.

## **🔥 Motivations**

### **1. Narrow Perceptual Dimensions**
Most systems rely on surface-level behavior features, lacking:
- affective understanding  
- behavioral continuity  
- environmental causal context  

### **2. Fragmented & Sensitive Data**
Multimodal sensory streams are:
- fragmented across devices  
- difficult to align  
- privacy-sensitive and unsafe for direct cloud processing  

### **3. Weak Intent Modeling**
Conventional systems are reactive.  
They struggle with:
- implicit intent detection  
- causal reasoning across user behavior  
- lack of high-quality intent-labeled datasets

## **🚀 System Architecture**

### **1. Perception Layer — Multimodal Sensing**
High-dimensional continuous perception from:
- RGB video  
- audio  
- motion & position  
- biosignals (EEG, heart rate, etc.)  

Real-time extraction of user state:  
**emotion, action, location, posture, attention, activity continuity**.

---

### **2. Synthesis Layer — Privacy-Enhanced State Abstraction**
Local processing performs:
- multimodal feature extraction  
- temporal alignment  
- semantic compression  
- privacy-preserving transformation  

Output:  
**natural-language state snapshots** of user + environment.

---

### **3. Digital Twin Layer — Intent-Labeled Dataset Generation**
The system constructs a **detached, privacy-independent digital twin**, enabling:

- retrospective intent labeling  
- Action → Intent causal chain construction  
- dataset generation for training **Nowcast/Forecast models**
