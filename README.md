## 🔥 Motivations

- **Limited Perceptual Dimensions**
    
    Most existing systems rely on shallow behavior modeling, lacking comprehensive understanding of user emotion, behavioral continuity, underlying motivations, and the influence of environmental context.
    
- **Fragmented and Sensitive Data**
    
    Multi-source sensory data is often fragmented and lacks unified structure. Moreover, the raw data is privacy-sensitive, posing significant challenges for secure integration and analysis.
    
- **Weak Intent Inference**
    
    Current systems mainly respond to explicit commands, failing to recognize or predict users' implicit intents. This reflects a dual challenge: the absence of high-quality annotated datasets and the lack of effective predictive models.
    

## 🚀 Key Features / System Design

### 1. Perception Layer: Human-Centric Multimodal Contextual Perception

Capturing high-dimensional signals from diverse modalities, such as vision, audio, motion, and even biosignals, to enable deep, real-time perception of user state.

### 2. Synthesis Layer: Privacy-Enhanced Feature Synthesis

Locally extracting and aligning features from continuous multimodal data streams, and synthesizing them into natural language that captures semantic snapshots of both user and environment states.

### **3. DT Layer: LLM enpowered Intent-Labeled Behavior Dataset Generation**

Using digital twin analysis to label user intent retrospectively and construct privacy-independent causal chains between actions and intents, forming structured datasets for training intent nowcast\forcast models.
